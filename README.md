In a file called nlp_1.pdf, categorise which type of NLP application applies for
each of the following use-cases:
(Use the categories we have discussed on this bootcamp so far)
a. A model that allocates which mail folder an email should be sent to
(work, friends, promotions, important), like Gmail’s inbox tabs.
b. A model that helps decide what grade to award to an essay question.
This can be used by a university professor who grades a lot of classes
or essay competitions.
c. A model that provides assistive technology for doctors to provide
their diagnosis. Remember, doctors ask questions, so the model will
use the patients’ answers to provide probable diagnosis for the
doctor to weigh and make decisions
